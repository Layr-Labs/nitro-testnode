### WASM Root Transition Evidence
**Proof of dual WASM root support during transition (pre-consensus upgrade):**
```
INFO [08-13|11:18:19.397] validated execution messageCount=10 globalstate="..." WasmRoots="[0xc723bd1be9fc564796bd8ce5c158c8b2f55d34afb38303a9fb6a8f0fda376edb 0x39a7b951167ada11dc7c81f1707fb06e6710ca8b915b2f49e03c130bf7cd53b1]"
```

**Proof of exclusive new WASM root usage (post-consensus upgrade):**
```  
INFO [08-13|11:33:10.946] validated execution messageCount=16 globalstate="..." WasmRoots=[0x39a7b951167ada11dc7c81f1707fb06e6710ca8b915b2f49e03c130bf7cd53b1]
```

**Proof of validator detecting WASM root progression:**
```
INFO [08-13|11:32:00.401] Block validator: detected progressing to pending machine hash=39a7b9..cd53b1
```

This demonstrates:
1. ✅ **Safe transition**: Validator supported both WASM roots during node software upgrade
2. ✅ **Successful consensus upgrade**: On-chain transaction successfully set new WASM module root
3. ✅ **Validation continuity**: Validator seamlessly transitioned from `messageCount=10` to `messageCount=16` across the upgrade
4. ✅ **Final state**: Validator now exclusively uses v3.5.7 WASM root for all validations

## Node Software Bump
### Upgrade Process
1. **Pre-upgrade Validation**: ✅ Pass - EigenDA Scenario 1 cluster setup successfully
2. **Service Orchestration**: ✅ Pass - Critical services (redis, eigenda_proxy, minio) preserved during upgrade
3. **Image Management**: ✅ Pass - Successfully tagged v3.5.7 as `nitro-node-dev-testnode-to`
4. **Configuration Update**: ✅ Pass - Updated all image references in docker-compose.yaml
5. **Service Restart**: ✅ Pass - All services restarted with new v3.5.7 image
6. **Post-upgrade Validation**: ✅ Pass - All EigenDA tests completed successfully

### Service Status After Upgrade
- **eigenda-proxy**: ✅ Running (port 4242)
- **poster**: ✅ Running (using v3.5.7 image)
- **sequencer**: ✅ Running (using v3.5.7 image) 
- **validator**: ✅ Running (using v3.5.7 image)
- **geth**: ✅ Running (L1 chain)
- **validation_node**: ✅ Running (using v3.5.7 image)
- **redis**: ✅ Running
- **minio**: ✅ Running

## Chain-of-Thought Analysis
1. **Version Validation**: Both v3.5.6 and v3.5.7 containers verified as available from ghcr.io/layr-labs/nitro registry
2. **Consensus Detection**: WASM module root comparison revealed significant differences requiring consensus upgrade
3. **Upgrade Strategy**: Executed careful orchestration preserving critical shared services during node software transition
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Validated both WASM roots were supported during transition period before consensus upgrade
5. **Validation Approach**: Used comprehensive EigenDA Scenario 1 testing to verify functionality pre/post upgrade

## Validation Results
### Functional Testing
- **Service Health**: ✅ All required services running and responding
- **EigenDA Integration**: ✅ EigenDA proxy operational, batch posting via EigenDA confirmed
- **L2 Transaction Processing**: ✅ 5 test transactions processed successfully (blocks 11-15)
- **L1 to L2 Deposits**: ✅ Bridge deposit successful with proper DelayedMessage processing
- **Validator Operation**: ✅ Validator successfully using new WASM module root exclusively
- **State Root Validation**: ✅ Consistent messageCount=16 across validator, poster, and sequencer
- **Network Connectivity**: ✅ All inter-service communication functional

### Performance Metrics  
- **Upgrade Duration**: ~25 minutes total
- **Downtime**: ~5 minutes for node services (L1 chain and critical infrastructure remained online)
- **Data Loss**: None - all state preserved

## Security Considerations
- **Private Key Management**: ✅ Proper extraction and handling of rollup owner keys
- **Contract Verification**: ✅ Upgrade transaction confirmed on-chain with proper event logs
- **Rollup Integrity**: ✅ Validator transitioned from dual WASM root support to exclusive v3.5.7 usage

## Recommendations
1. **Future Upgrades**: Document the successful preservation strategy for redis/eigenda_proxy/minio during node upgrades
2. **Monitoring**: Continue monitoring validator logs to ensure stable operation with new WASM module root
3. **Batch Posting**: Monitor poster service for any batch posting issues, though L2 functionality remains operational
4. **Documentation**: Update operational procedures to reflect the upgrade process workflow

## Next Steps
1. **Monitor**: Continue observing system performance for 24-48 hours post-upgrade
2. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary containers and unused images: `docker system prune`
3. **Archive**: Preserve upgrade transaction hash and deployment artifacts for audit trail

## Conclusion
**Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL UPGRADE COMPLETED**

The v3.5.6 → v3.5.7 upgrade executed successfully with both node software bump and consensus upgrade. All EigenDA integration tests pass, demonstrating full functionality preservation. The validator has successfully transitioned to using the new WASM module root exclusively, confirming proper consensus state transition.
