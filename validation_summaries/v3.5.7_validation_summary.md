## Testing Analysis

### Scenario 1 (EigenDA with Arbitrator Interpreter Validation)
**Configuration:** enable-eigenda-failover=false, use-jit=true

**Test case 1:** Successfully executed 5 L2 transactions. No terminal errors like execution reverted loops or continuous ERROR messages observed in batch poster logs. Batch posting was functioning correctly.

**Test case 2:** Bridge transaction completed successfully (tx hash: 0x9615ac1ed716b5c0ee19f13a31f4a939aef06ec3c0ecb14e798a1fcdbccf497d). Observed expected logs in sequencer showing "ExecutionEngine: Added DelayedMessages pos=18 delayed=12" and in poster showing "BatchPoster: batch sent eigenDA=true ... prevDelayed=11 currentDelayed=12".

**Test case 3:** Validator logs showed successful validation execution with messageCount=18 and messageCount=20, displaying proper global state information including BlockHash, SendRoot, Batch numbers, and WasmRoots=[0xd5c515b0f4a3450ffc8b4086c1de4c484c5efea878e5491e47bd20fb4649c52e]. InboxTracker logs confirmed proper sequencer batch counting and message tracking.

**Key Observations:**
- Sequencer required restart after hanging post-"EigenDA enabled" log (as documented in instructions)
- EigenDA integration working correctly with failover=false anytrust=false
- All services (eigenda_proxy, poster, sequencer, validator, geth, validation_node) operational
- Batch posting confirmed with "BatchPoster: batch sent eigenDA=true" logs

### Scenario 2 (EigenDA with Validation & AnyTrust Failover)
**Configuration:** enable-eigenda-failover=true, use-jit=true

**Test case 1:** Successfully executed 5 L2 transactions. No terminal errors observed.

**Test case 2:** Bridge functionality confirmed operational (similar behavior to Scenario 1).

**Test case 3:** Validation processes functioning correctly with proper state tracking.

**Key Observations:**
- EigenDA integration working correctly with failover=true anytrust=true
- Additional AnyTrust services (das-committee-a, das-committee-b, das-mirror) running successfully
- Batch posting confirmed with "BatchPoster: batch sent eigenDA=true" logs
- All required services for AnyTrust failover scenario operational

### Technical Notes
- Both scenarios encountered the documented sequencer hang issue after "EigenDA enabled" log
- Restarting sequencer resolved the issue in both cases
- Module root consistent across scenarios: 0xd5c515b0f4a3450ffc8b4086c1de4c484c5efea878e5491e47bd20fb4649c52e
- No execution reverted death loops or continuous ERROR messages observed in either scenario
- EigenDA proxy service successfully handling blob storage and retrieval

## Conclusion
Both completed scenarios (1 and 2) demonstrate successful EigenDA integration with Arbitrum Nitro. The testnode cluster performs correctly with both standard EigenDA configuration and EigenDA with AnyTrust failover enabled. All core functionality including batch posting, transaction processing, and validation are working as expected.

Scenario 3 testing was not completed due to time constraints but would follow the same validation pattern with the addition of TokenBridge functionality.
