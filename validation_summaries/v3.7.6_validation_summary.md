- ✅ Layer 3 Testing: **PASS**

### Scenario 5 - EigenDA with Validation & Timeboost:
- ❌ Feature not available in v3.7.6

## Testing Analysis:

### Scenario 1:
- **Test case 1**: Observed successful batch posting logs with `Dispersing batch as blob to EigenDA` and `BatchPoster: batch sent eigenDA=true 4844=false sequenceNumber=2`. No terminal errors found.
- **Test case 2**: Bridge deposit transaction successfully processed. Sequencer logs showed `ExecutionEngine: Added DelayedMessages` progression. Poster logs confirmed batch posting with delayed message processing.
- **Test case 3**: Validator logs demonstrated successful state progression with consistent validation execution showing messageCount progression and matching globalstate updates. WasmRoots remained consistent at `0x34454ede1b5edaee4c5d6c5ccebb20d5cc15d71cf662525be089a60925865ed0`.

### Scenario 2:
- **Test case 1**: Successfully demonstrated batch posting with `eigenDA=true` and `failover=true anytrust=false` configuration.
- **Test case 2**: Bridge deposits processed correctly in failover-enabled environment.
- **Test case 3**: Validation continued successfully with failover enabled.
- **Failover Testing**: Successfully triggered failover by setting `PutReturnsFailoverError: true` on EigenDA proxy at `http://localhost:4242/memstore/config`. System correctly switched from `eigenDA=true` (Batch #2) to `eigenDA=false` (Batch #3, AnyTrust mode). Complete failover demonstrated: EigenDA → AnyTrust with no transaction loss.

### Scenario 3:
- **Test case 1**: EigenDA batch posting functional with TokenBridge v1.2.2 enabled. Observed successful `Dispersing batch as blob to EigenDA` and `BatchPoster: batch sent eigenDA=true` logs. Multiple batches posted (#2, #3) with varying data lengths.
- **Test case 2**: TokenBridge deposit functionality verified. ERC20 token deployed at `0x11B57FE348584f042E436c6Bf7c3c3deF171de49`. Five transactions sent successfully with batches posted to EigenDA.
- **Test case 3**: Validator showed consistent execution validation with messageCount progression and stable WasmRoots. All 4 batches validated successfully.

### Scenario 4:
- **Layer 2 Testing**: Successfully validated EigenDA integration on Layer 2. Chain ID 412346 operational with `eigenDA=true` batch posting. Multiple batches posted successfully (#18-22) with data lengths ranging from 1348 to 4114 bytes.
- **Layer 3 Testing**: L3 node successfully deployed on chain ID 333333. L3 transactions confirmed (tx hash: `0x594bb5e60f8899eee2a7bea37c53a0418a9e599fb2e8a8c1ec5581516b4b3a3b`, 0.01 ETH sent, gas used: 22,982). L3 correctly inherits DA from EigenDA-backed L2. Both sequencer and poster demonstrated successful blob retrieval from EigenDA (batchID=69). L3 node correctly falls back to calldata pricing model (expected behavior with non-4844 parent chain).

### Scenario 5:
- **Timeboost Feature**: Attempted initialization with `--l2-timeboost` flag. Sequencer failed with configuration error: `'execution.sequencer.dangerous' has invalid keys: timeboost`. This confirms Timeboost feature is not available in v3.7.6 binary. Feature appears in later versions.

## Key Findings:
1. ✅ EigenDA integration is functional with proper batch dispersion and retrieval
2. ✅ Arbitrator interpreter validation works correctly with EigenDA
3. ✅ AnyTrust failover mechanism operates as designed (EigenDA → AnyTrust)
4. ✅ TokenBridge v1.2.2 compatible with EigenDA infrastructure
5. ✅ Multi-layer architecture (L2+L3) operational with EigenDA as L2's DA layer
6. ✅ State progression and validation remain consistent across all tested scenarios
7. ✅ No terminal errors or death loops observed in any tested configuration
8. ❌ Timeboost feature not available in v3.7.6 (requires v3.8.0+)

## Infrastructure Validation:
- **Container Health**: All required services (eigenda_proxy v1.8.2, poster, sequencer, validator, geth, validation_node, l3node) started and operated successfully
- **AnyTrust Components**: Failover functionality verified through EigenDA proxy memstore configuration
- **Multi-Layer Setup**: 7 services operational (eigenda_proxy, geth, sequencer, poster, redis, l3node, validation_node)
- **Network Communication**: All inter-service communication verified through log analysis
- **Configuration Management**: Dynamic configuration changes for failover testing executed successfully

**Total Test Scenarios Completed**: 4/5 (Scenario 5 not applicable to v3.7.6)
**Overall Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All EigenDA core functionality validated across all applicable scenarios
